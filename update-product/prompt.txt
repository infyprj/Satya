My user interface is, In one web page all the products available will be displayed. If the user who logged in is admin, the admin has only 3 operations which are adding the product,deleting the product and updating the product.
Now if the user who logged in is admin, then below of each product thumbnail there will be 2 buttons which are update and delete.
These are visible to only admin. And these buttons are visible below to each product thumbnail.
Now i need to implement the component of update-product.
How need it to work is, when i click the update button then a page need to be open where there will be a form opened with all the product values filled.
Now when i changed those values and clicked the submit button, the values should be changed in the database.
I will keep the coresponding web api link for you.::
Request body
{
  "productId": 1,
  "name": "string",
  "description": "asdfghj",
  "price": 1,
  "categoryId": 1,
  "modelUrl": "string",
  "thumbnailUrl": "string",
  "quantity": 1
}

Curl

curl -X 'PUT' \
  'https://localhost:7195/api/Product/UpdateProduct' \
  -H 'accept: */*' \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{
  "productId": 1,
  "name": "string",

  "price": 1,
  "categoryId": 1,
  "modelUrl": "string",
  "thumbnailUrl": "string",
  "quantity": 1
}'
